JumuiaPay Application  
Simplifying Financial Management for Chamas  

 ðŸ“Œ Overview  
JumuiaPay is a digital platform designed to help Chamas (informal savings groups) in Kenya manage their finances more effectively. The app provides real-time tracking of contributions, withdrawals, and loans, making it easier for Chamas to stay transparent, accountable, and organized.

 ðŸš€ Our Goal 
Chamas are an important part of Kenyaâ€™s financial system, helping members save and access credit. However, many Chamas still use manual record-keeping, which leads to errors, disputes, and even fraud. JumuiaPay solves these problems by offering:  

- Real-Time Transaction Tracking   
- Automated Record-Keeping  
- Member Contribution Monitoring 
- Expense and Loan Management   
- Visual Financial Reports 

Our goal is to make Chama financial management simpler, more transparent, and more efficient.

 ðŸ”§ How Itâ€™s Built  
- Frontend: React.js (for a user-friendly interface).

- Authentication: Firebase Auth (for secure user login).  
- Charts and Reports: Chart.js (for financial visualizations).  



 ðŸ›  How Weâ€™re Building It  
Weâ€™re using Agile Development, which means we build the app in small steps, test it often, and improve it based on feedback.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
