JumuiaPay Application  
Simplifying Financial Management for Chamas  

 ðŸ“Œ Overview  
JumuiaPay is a digital platform designed to help Chamas (informal savings groups) in Kenya manage their finances more effectively. The app provides real-time tracking of contributions, withdrawals, and loans, making it easier for Chamas to stay transparent, accountable, and organized.

 ðŸš€ Our Goal 
Chamas are an important part of Kenyaâ€™s financial system, helping members save and access credit. However, many Chamas still use manual record-keeping, which leads to errors, disputes, and even fraud. JumuiaPay solves these problems by offering:  

- Real-Time Transaction Tracking   
- Automated Record-Keeping  
- Member Contribution Monitoring 
- Expense and Loan Management   
- Visual Financial Reports 

Our goal is to make Chama financial management simpler, more transparent, and more efficient.
